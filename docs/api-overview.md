# API Introduction

The LianLian Pay API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

You can use it in test mode, which does not affect your live data or interact with the banking networks. The API key you use to authenticate the request determines whether the request is live mode or test mode.

# Versioning

When we make backwards-incompatible changes to the API, we release new versions.  The version to use is specified in the URL.  The current version for Collections is v1 such as:

```
https://api.lianlianglobal.com/payments/v1/...
```

# Authentication

The LianLian API uses an API key to authenticate requests. You will receive your `token` from LianLian Global.  The `Authorization` header must be included in all requests with the following format:

```
Authorization: Basic {token}
```

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

# Preventing replay attacks

A replay attack is when an attacker intercepts a valid payload and its signature, then re-transmits them. To mitigate such attacks, LianLian includes a timestamp in the LLPAY-Signature header for requests and for responses. Because this timestamp is part of the signed payload, it is also verified by the signature, so an attacker cannot change the timestamp without invalidating the signature. If the signature is valid but the timestamp is too old, the call will be rejected.

### Verifying signatures

The LLPAY-Signature header contains a timestamp and one or more signatures. The timestamp is prefixed by t=, and each signature is prefixed by a scheme. Schemes start with v, followed by an integer. Currently, the only valid signature scheme is v1. 

```
LLPAY-Signature: t=1492774577, v1=5257a869e7ecebeda32affa62cdca3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff536d0ce8e108d8bd
```

Note that newlines have been added in the example above for clarity, but a real LLPAY-Signature header will be all one line.

Lianlian Pay and clients shall exchange each partyâ€™s public key.  The LLPAY-Signature will be signed by with the RSA private key.

**Step 1:** Determine the signature payload

Create a `payload` string which is the following separated by `&`

* HTTP_METHOD: The actual method defined for specific API endpoint `POST`
* URI: The request's URL Path, URI.  `/api/mkt/balance`
* REQUEST_EPOCH: The seconds elapsed since 1970/1/1 00:00:00 GMT  same as value of `t`
* REQUEST_PAYLOAD: The contents of request body, typically in JSON format  `{"currency":"USD"}`
* QUERY_STRING: The query string of the URL, URL Encoded.  `attr1%3Dvalue1%26attr2%3Dvalue2`

Example `payload`:
```
POST&collections/v1/merchants&19879234&{"currency":"USD"}&attr1%3Dvalue1%26attr2%3Dvalue2
```

**Step 2:** Prepare the `LLPAY-Signature` string

You achieve this by concatenating:
* The timestamp (Seconds elapsed since 1970/1/1 00:00:00 GMT as a string)
* The character `,`
* Use your RSA private key and calculate the string `BASE64(RSA(payload))` from Step 1

### Result Signature

LianLian result headers also contain the `LLPAY-Signature` header as described above but signed with Lian Lian Global's private RSA key.  You may verify the signature corresponds to the Result body by calculating the signature and comparing it to the unencrypted version of `LLPAY-Signature` using the Lian Lian Global public RSA key.  Here are the steps:

**Step 1:** Determine the signature `payload`

Create a `payload` string which is the following separated by `&`

* Response Timestamp: Extract t from LLPay-Signature and use it as timestamp
* Response Payload: The contents of response body, typically in JSON format  `{"currency":"USD"}`

Example `payload`:
```
19879234&{"currency":"USD"}
```

**Step 2:** Use RSA Verify to compare signatures

Compare the LLPay-Signature received with the `payload` calculated in Step 1 using the Lian Lian Global Public Key using the following algorithm:

```
RSA.verify( LLPAY-Signature, 
            '19879234&{" currency":"USD"}', 
            Lian Lian Global Public Key )
```


# Results

#### Success

A successful API call returns a conventional HTTP response with status 2xx indicating success.  The result objects are standard REST resources.  Example:

```
{
  "name": "Merchant Name",
  ...
}
```
or
```
[
  {
    "name": "Merchant Name",
    ...
  },
  {
    "name": "Merchant Name 2",
    ...
  }
]
```

#### Errors

LianLian uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with LianLian's servers (these are rare).

Some 4xx errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g., a validation error) include an error code that briefly explains the error reported.

#### Attributes

***code*** *number*
One of ERROR CODES as described in table below


### HTTP STATUS CODE SUMMARY 
|CODE | DESCRIPTION|
|---------|----------|
|200 | Bad Request	The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.|
|401 | Unauthorized	No valid API key provided.|
|402 | Request Failed	The parameters were valid but the request failed.|
|403 | Forbidden	The API key doesn't have permissions to perform the request.|
|404 | Not Found	The requested resource doesn't exist.|
|409 | Conflict	The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key).|
|429 | Too Many Requests	Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests.|
|500, 502, 503, 504 | Server Errors	Something went wrong on LianLian's end. (These are rare.)|


### ERROR CODES
|STATUS | CODE | DESCRIPTION|
---------|---------|----------|
|400 | 10004 | Not good|

### Body

```
{
  "code": "10004",
  "message": "Not good"
}
```

# Idempotent Requests

All POST, PUT, and DELETE requests are idempotent for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. 

This is useful when an API call is disrupted in transit and you do not receive a response. For example, if a request to create a charge does not respond due to a network connection error, you can retry the request with the same idempotency key to guarantee that no more than one charge is created.

LianLian's idempotency works by saving the resulting status code and body of the first request made for any given idempotency key, regardless of whether it succeeded or failed. Subsequent requests with the same BODY & Signature return the same result, except for internal 500 errors.

# Request IDs

Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under `Request-Id`. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.


# Argument and Field Naming

LianLian arguments and object field names follow standard underscore naming such as:

```
https://api...com/resource/?filter_by="filter"
```

```
{
  "store_name": "My Store",
  "kyc_status": "success"
}
```

# Pagination

All top-level API resources have support for bulk fetches via "list" API methods. For instance, you can list charges, list customers, and list invoices. These list API methods share a common structure, taking at least these three parameters: limit, starting_after, and ending_before.

Stripe utilizes cursor-based pagination via the starting_after and ending_before parameters. Both parameters take an existing object ID value (see below) and return objects in reverse chronological order. The ending_before parameter returns objects listed before the named object. The starting_after parameter returns objects listed after the named object. If both parameters are provided, only ending_before is used.

#### Query Arguments

| Argument | Details | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------| 
| limit | optional, default is 10 | A limit on the number of objects to be returned, between 1 and 100. |
| starting_after | optional | A cursor for use in pagination. starting_after is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include starting_after=obj_foo in order to fetch the next page of the list. |

#### Paginated List Response Object

| Field | Type | Description |
| ---------|----------|-------|
| data | array | An array containing the actual response elements, paginated by any request parameters. |
| has_more | boolean | Whether or not there are more elements available after this set. If false, this set comprises the end of the list. |
| starting_after | string | Next starting_after parameter to use for next page |
| total | number | Total number of items in list |
```
{
  "total": 252,
  "has_more": true,
  "staring_after": "token",
  "has_more": true,
  "list": [
    {
      "name": "Merchant Name"
    }
  ]
}
```

# Webhook Endpoints

You can configure webhook endpoints via the API to be notified about events that happen in your Lian Lian Group account.
